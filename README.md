#  Identifying Customer Segments 

## Project Motivation
This project involved applying unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data used was provided by Udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.

## Libraries used 
All the libraries used are available in a standard Anaconda distribution - the only extra library I used was the [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) library.

## Files in this repository

* notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the main steps of the analysis
* helper.py: Python file containing the main functions used in the notebook
